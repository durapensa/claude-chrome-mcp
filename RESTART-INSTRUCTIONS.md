# Restart Instructions - Event-Driven Completion Detection

**Date**: 2025-05-31  
**Context**: Event-Driven Completion Detection Implementation Complete  
**Next Task**: Test the new async tools and event-driven system

## 🚀 Session Context

### ✅ Major Achievement Completed
Successfully implemented **Event-Driven Completion Detection System** with:
- OperationManager: Async operation state management with persistence
- NotificationManager: MCP notification system for progress updates  
- ConversationObserver: DOM MutationObserver for milestone detection
- New async tools: send_message_async, get_response_async, wait_for_operation
- **All code committed** - Complete event-driven architecture replacing timeout-based operations

### 📁 Key Files Modified
- `mcp-server/src/server.js` - Added OperationManager, NotificationManager, async tools
- `extension/content.js` - Added ConversationObserver with DOM monitoring
- `extension/background.js` - Added operation milestone forwarding
- State persistence: `mcp-server/.operations-state.json` (auto-created)

### 🎯 Current Status
- **System**: v2.3.0 with event-driven completion detection
- **Event-Driven Framework**: Ready for testing
- **Last Issue**: MCP server crash during testing
- **Status**: Clean restart needed - all code committed and ready

## 🔄 Restart Checklist

### 1. **Chrome Extension Reload**
```bash
# In Chrome: chrome://extensions/
# Find "Claude Chrome MCP" extension
# Click "Reload" button
# Verify extension loads correctly
```

### 2. **Verify System Health**
```bash
# After restarting Claude Code, run:
mcp__claude-chrome-mcp__get_connection_health
```

### 3. **Test Event-Driven Tools**
```bash
# Test new async tools
mcp__claude-chrome-mcp__send_message_async
mcp__claude-chrome-mcp__get_response_async
mcp__claude-chrome-mcp__wait_for_operation
```

## 🎪 What to Expect

### **Event-Driven Testing Process**
1. **System Health**: Verify all components are connected
2. **Async Tool Testing**: Test new event-driven tools
   - send_message_async: Returns operation ID immediately
   - get_response_async: Returns operation ID immediately
   - wait_for_operation: Waits for completion and returns results
3. **Milestone Detection**: ConversationObserver monitors DOM changes
   - Message sent detection
   - Response started detection
   - Response completion detection
4. **Notifications**: Real-time MCP notifications for progress

### **Expected Benefits**
- No more arbitrary timeouts
- Faster, more reliable operations
- Real-time progress notifications
- Better error handling and recovery

## 🔧 If Issues Persist

### **MCP Server Issues**
```bash
# Check for hanging processes
ps aux | grep -E "(node.*server\.js)"

# Kill if needed  
pkill -f "node.*server\.js"

# Check hub port
lsof -i :54321
```

### **Chrome Extension Issues**
- Reload extension in chrome://extensions/
- Check background script console for errors
- Verify popup loads and shows connection status

### **Event-Driven System Issues**
- All infrastructure components have been implemented
- OperationManager handles state persistence and recovery
- ConversationObserver provides real-time DOM monitoring

## 📝 Session Continuation Command

When you restart Claude Code, simply type:

```
continue
```

This will:
1. Verify system health and connections
2. Test the new event-driven completion detection tools
3. Validate DOM milestone detection
4. Demonstrate async operation handling with real-time notifications

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ System connects and health check passes  
✅ Async tools return operation IDs immediately  
✅ ConversationObserver detects milestones correctly  
✅ MCP notifications are sent for progress updates  
✅ wait_for_operation returns completed results

**Event-Driven System Status**: ✅ **Ready for Testing**  
**Next Action**: Test async tools and validate milestone detection
