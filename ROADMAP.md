# Roadmap

## Recently Completed (January 30, 2025) ✅

### Infrastructure & Testing
- ✅ Test lifecycle management with automatic cleanup
- ✅ Smart test runner with failure tracking  
- ✅ Standardized error codes across components
- ✅ Structured logging with rate limiting
- ✅ Response cache implementation (600x speedup)
- ✅ Tab pool prototype for connection reuse
- ✅ Comprehensive test documentation
- ✅ Verified all MCP tools working correctly

## Q1 2025

### Test Architecture Improvements
- [ ] Refactor test suite to use shared MCP connections
- [ ] Create integration tests that don't spawn new servers
- [ ] Add mock MCP server for unit testing
- [ ] Implement test fixtures for common scenarios

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement streaming response updates
- [x] Add response caching for repeated queries ✅ (LRU cache with TTL)
- [x] Connection pooling for tab management ✅ (Tab pool prototype)
  - Maintain pool of ready tabs for instant use
  - Automatic cleanup of idle tabs
  - Configurable pool size limits

### Reliability Improvements
- [x] Add automatic retry logic for transient failures ✅ (Implemented with maxRetries parameter)
- [x] Implement exponential backoff for rate limiting ✅ (1s, 2s, 4s backoff)
- [x] Add health check endpoint for monitoring ✅ (get_connection_health tool)
- [x] Improve error messages with specific error codes ✅ (Standardized error codes)
- [x] Add structured logging system ✅ (Logger with rate limiting)
  - JSON-formatted logs
  - Log levels and filtering
  - Correlation IDs for request tracking

### New Features
- [ ] Support for conversation search/filtering
- [ ] Bulk conversation management (archive, delete multiple)
- [ ] Conversation templates and quick starts
- [ ] Export to multiple formats (PDF, DOCX)

## Q2 2025

### Architecture Enhancements

#### Event-Driven Message Bus
- Decouple components with event-based architecture
- Enable plugin system for extensibility
- Improve testability and maintainability
- Example implementation:
  ```javascript
  bus.on('tab.created', async (tab) => {
    await analytics.track('tab_created', tab);
    await pool.register(tab);
  });
  ```

#### Tool Registry Pattern
- Self-registering tools for modularity
- Dynamic tool discovery and loading
- Simplified tool addition/removal
- Schema validation built-in

#### Plugin Architecture
- Hot-reloadable plugins
- Hooks for all major operations
- Community plugin support
- Example plugins:
  - Rate limiting
  - Request logging
  - Response caching
  - Custom authentication

#### Middleware Pipeline
- Composable request/response handling
- Built-in middleware:
  - Validation
  - Authentication
  - Rate limiting
  - Error handling
- Custom middleware support

### Advanced Capabilities
- [ ] Real-time collaboration features
- [ ] Conversation branching and versioning
- [ ] Advanced DOM manipulation tools
- [ ] Custom artifact handling

### Developer Experience
- [ ] TypeScript types for all APIs
- [ ] Comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Example scripts and use cases
- [ ] Integration tests suite
- [ ] CLI tool improvements

### Enterprise Features
- [ ] Multi-account support
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Rate limiting controls
- [ ] Custom model configuration
- [ ] Layered configuration system
  - Environment variables
  - Config files
  - Runtime overrides
  - Secure secrets management

## Q3 2025

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Performance metrics collection
- [ ] Distributed tracing support
- [ ] Health dashboard
- [ ] Alert system integration

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Request signing/verification
- [ ] API key rotation
- [ ] Permission system for tools
- [ ] Conversation encryption options

## Future Considerations

### Architecture Improvements
- Consider migrating to Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- Evaluate WebSocket alternatives (SSE, long polling)
- Implement proper message queuing system
- Add telemetry and analytics

### Integration Opportunities
- VS Code extension integration
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Slack/Discord bot integration
- API gateway for web access

### Performance Optimizations
- Request batching and deduplication
- Intelligent prefetching
- Response compression
- Database for conversation caching
