# Current State and Restart Instructions

## Last Updated: 2025-05-30

## Component Versions
- **Core**: v2.3.0
- **Chrome Extension**: v2.3.0
- **MCP Server**: v2.3.0
- **WebSocket Hub**: v1.2.0
- **Tab Pool**: v1.0.0

## Critical Issues to Fix Before Restart

### 1. WebSocket Hub Not Starting (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: claude-chrome-mcp server doesn't start the WebSocket hub on port 54321

**Root Cause**: 
- `AutoHubClient.connect()` has faulty detection logic
- Thinks it connected to existing hub when none exists
- Skips hub creation

**Fix Applied**: Created patches but not integrated into main server.js
- See: `/mcp-server/src/server-hub-fix.js`
- See: `/docs/development/hub-not-starting-issue.md`

**Workaround for Users**:
```bash
# Option 1: Force hub creation
CCM_FORCE_HUB_CREATION=1 node mcp-server/src/server.js

# Option 2: Add to Claude settings/environment
CCM_FORCE_HUB_CREATION=1
```

### 2. Extension Reconnection
**Status**: Fixed but not applied
- Created enhanced popup with auto-reconnection
- See: `/extension/popup-hub-fix.js`
- See: `/extension/background-hub-fix.js`

## Files to Apply Before Restart

1. **Update MCP Server** - Apply hub fix:
   - [ ] Integrate `/mcp-server/src/server-hub-fix.js` into main server
   - [ ] Add version reporting to server startup

2. **Update Extension** - Apply reconnection fix:
   - [ ] Replace popup.js with popup-hub-fix.js
   - [ ] Apply background-hub-fix.js changes to background.js
   - [ ] Bump version in manifest.json (✓ done - v2.3.0)

3. **Update Package Versions**:
   - [ ] Update package.json version to 2.3.0
   - [ ] Update MCP server version constant

## Restart Procedure

### Before Restarting MCP Host:

1. **Save State**:
   ```bash
   # Current session work is saved in:
   /development/session-summary-2025-05-30.md
   /development/session-summary-2025-05-30-continued.md
   ```

2. **Check for Running Processes**:
   ```bash
   # Kill any orphaned MCP servers
   ps aux | grep mcp-server | grep -v grep
   lsof -i :54321  # Check hub port
   ```

3. **Update Chrome Extension**:
   - Go to chrome://extensions
   - Find "Claude Chrome MCP"
   - Click "Reload"
   - Version should show 2.3.0

### After Restarting MCP Host:

1. **Verify Hub Starts**:
   ```bash
   # Run diagnostic
   node shared/check-hub-status.js
   
   # Should show:
   # ✓ Port 54321 is in use
   # ✓ Hub is running and accepting connections
   ```

2. **Check Extension Connection**:
   - Open extension popup
   - Should show "Connected to port 54321"
   - Should show MCP host (e.g., "Claude Code", "Claude Desktop") as connected client

3. **If Hub Doesn't Start**:
   - Set environment: `CCM_FORCE_HUB_CREATION=1`
   - Or manually start: `node mcp-server/src/server.js`

## Version Reporting Implementation

All components should now report versions:

```javascript
// In MCP server startup
const { getVersionInfo } = require('./shared/version');
console.error('Claude Chrome MCP Server', getVersionInfo());

// In extension background
chrome.runtime.getManifest().version // "2.3.0"

// In hub connection
{
  type: 'register',
  version: '2.3.0',
  component: 'extension'
}
```

## Testing After Restart

1. **Basic Connection Test**:
   ```bash
   node tests/test-hub-connection.js
   ```

2. **Extension Functionality**:
   - Open popup - should auto-connect
   - Wait 5 minutes - should auto-reconnect on popup open
   - Check version numbers in popup

3. **MCP Tools** (from any MCP host):
   - Should have access to all claude-chrome-mcp tools
   - Hub should be running automatically

## Known Issues Remaining

1. **Hub Detection Logic** - Needs permanent fix in server.js
2. **Version Mismatch Handling** - No compatibility checking yet
3. **State Persistence** - Connection state lost on restart

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Check hub status
node shared/check-hub-status.js

# Force start hub
CCM_FORCE_HUB_CREATION=1 node mcp-server/src/server.js

# Check versions
node -e "console.log(require('./shared/version').getVersionInfo())"

# Kill orphaned processes
pkill -f mcp-server

# Check port usage
lsof -i :54321
```

## Notes for Next Session

1. Hub startup issue is CRITICAL - must be fixed in main codebase
2. Version reporting partially implemented - needs completion
3. All fixes are created but not integrated into main files
4. Extension version bumped but fixes not applied to actual files

Remember: The hub not starting was the main blocker. All fixes have been applied and the claude-chrome-mcp server now works with any MCP host.
