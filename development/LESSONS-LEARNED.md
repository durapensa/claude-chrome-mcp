# Lessons Learned from Testing Session

## Key Insights

### 1. Default Values Matter
- Setting `waitForReady: true` as default prevents most message sending failures
- Users shouldn't need to remember this option for basic usage

### 2. Chrome Service Worker Behavior
- Chrome Alarms API (15-second interval) effectively prevents suspension
- Connection recovery after Chrome restart works well with exponential backoff
- WebSocket connections are more stable than expected with proper keepalive

### 3. Extraction Performance
- Batching is essential for large conversations
- Default limits (50 per type, 1000 total) are reasonable
- DOM operations can be expensive - limiting scope improves performance

### 4. Expected vs Actual Issues
- Some "issues" are actually expected behaviors (empty exports, null stop button)
- Clear documentation prevents confusion about normal behavior
- Testing revealed these aren't bugs but design decisions

### 5. Testing Best Practices
- Always verify tool responses with follow-up checks
- Test edge cases (empty conversations, rapid messages, large content)
- Chrome restarts are a good stress test for connection stability

## Potential Improvements

### High Value, Low Effort
1. Add connection status indicator in popup
2. Implement message retry on transient failures
3. Add progress bars for long operations

### Medium Value, Medium Effort
1. Message queue system for better reliability
2. Bulk conversation operations (export all, delete multiple)
3. Search within conversations

### Future Considerations
1. Performance metrics collection
2. Automated test suite using the created test scripts
3. WebSocket connection pooling for multiple MCP clients

## Edge Cases Discovered

1. **Tab Not Ready**: New tabs need time before accepting messages
2. **Response Timeouts**: Long responses can timeout with default MCP limits
3. **Chrome Restarts**: Extension handles well but needs manual reload sometimes
4. **Batch Timing**: Sequential batch messages need ~2-3 seconds between sends

## Documentation Gaps Fixed

- Updated ISSUES.md with testing notes and status clarifications
- Added default value notation to CLAUDE.md
- Created comprehensive TEST-RESULTS-SESSION.md
- This LESSONS-LEARNED.md for future reference
