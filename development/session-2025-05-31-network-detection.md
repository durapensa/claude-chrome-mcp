# Network-Level Response Detection Session - 2025-05-31

## Problem Identified
- MCP notifications working for `message_sent` but not `response_completed`
- DOM-based completion detection unreliable due to:
  - React batching DOM updates
  - Unpredictable timing of `[data-message-author-role="assistant"]` element addition
  - Content script persistence issues

## Key Insights
1. **Send button detection flawed**: Button stays disabled after completion until user types
2. **DOM mutations inconsistent**: React may batch updates, making timing unpredictable  
3. **Network layer most reliable**: Claude uses streaming responses - stream completion = response completion

## Solution Implemented
- Added `setupNetworkInterception()` to ConversationObserver
- Intercepts `window.fetch()` calls to Claude API endpoints
- Monitors stream completion using `response.body.getReader()`
- Triggers `checkResponseCompletion()` when stream ends

## Code Changes
- Updated `extension/content-fast.js`:
  - Added network interception in constructor
  - Implemented `monitorStreamCompletion()` method
  - Removed unreliable send button state logic

## Status
- Network detection implemented but not tested due to MCP connection loss
- Ready for testing after Claude Code restart

## Next Steps
1. Test network-level detection approach
2. Verify MCP notifications work for both `message_sent` and `response_completed`
3. Test on both fresh chats and existing conversations
4. Commit working solution
