# Session Summary - 2025-05-30 (Continued)

## Overview
Continued from earlier session, implementing remaining roadmap items and addressing hub connection issues.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Completed Test Suite Refactoring âœ…
- Created shared client infrastructure (`helpers/shared-client.js`)
- Built migration tools and adapter for gradual transition
- Documented migration process
- 5 tests already using shared pattern successfully

### 2. Tab Pool Production Implementation âœ…
- **Fixed Issues**:
  - Memory leaks (proper timer cleanup)
  - Race conditions (event-based coordination)
- **Added Features**:
  - Environment variable configuration
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Health checks before reuse
  - Graceful shutdown
- **Created**:
  - `shared/tab-pool-v2.js` - Production implementation
  - `mcp-server/src/tab-pool-wrapper.js` - Integration layer
  - Comprehensive test suite (all tests pass)

### 3. TypeScript Types for All APIs âœ…
- Created `shared/mcp-tool-types.ts` with:
  - Complete parameter types for all 26 tools
  - Response types for every API
  - Union types for generic handling
  - Type guards for runtime validation
- Added documentation and examples
- Verified compilation with strict TypeScript

### 4. Integration Tests (No Server Spawn) âœ…
- Created `tests/integration/` directory with:
  - Basic integration tests
  - Live MCP connection tests
  - Claude Code usage examples
- Tests can use existing MCP connections
- Safe, non-destructive testing approach

### 5. Hub Connection Issue Investigation ðŸ”§
- **Problem**: Extension shows "Hub Not Connected" even with Claude Code running
- **Root Cause**: MCP server not starting WebSocket hub on port 54321
- **Diagnosis**: Created diagnostic script `shared/check-hub-status.js`
- **Fixes Created**:
  - Enhanced popup with auto-reconnection
  - Background script improvements
  - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide

## Key Issues Discovered

### WebSocket Hub Not Starting
- MCP server's `AutoHubClient` might be detecting phantom hub
- Connection check gives false positive
- Hub startup fails silently or is skipped
- Result: No process listening on port 54321

### Workarounds Provided
1. Force hub creation with environment variable
2. Manual hub start command
3. Restart Claude Code

## Documentation Created
- `/docs/development/hub-reconnection-fix.md` - Reconnection implementation
- `/docs/development/hub-not-starting-issue.md` - Root cause analysis  
- `/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - User-facing troubleshooting guide
- `/docs/development/tab-pool-production-summary.md` - Tab pool details
- `/docs/TYPESCRIPT.md` - TypeScript usage guide

## Code Quality Improvements
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Improved logging and diagnostics
- Better state management
- Proper resource cleanup

## Testing
- All tab pool tests pass (7/7)
- TypeScript compilation verified
- Integration test framework established
- Hub diagnostic tools created

## Next Steps
1. Fix MCP server to reliably start hub in Claude Code environment
2. Add `CCM_FORCE_HUB_CREATION=1` to default environment
3. Improve hub detection logic to avoid false positives
4. Add hub status to MCP health check tool
5. Consider alternative IPC methods if WebSocket remains unreliable

## Session Stats
- Tasks Completed: 8 (4 major + 4 hub-related)
- Files Created: 15+
- Tests Written: 20+
- Documentation Pages: 6

## Recommendations
1. The hub startup issue is critical and affects all users
2. Consider making hub creation unconditional for Claude Code
3. Add better error reporting around hub initialization
4. Implement hub status monitoring in extension
