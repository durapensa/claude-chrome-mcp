# Session Summary - 2025-05-30

## Overview
Continued from previous session (2025-01-30) focusing on fixing the batch_get_responses timeout issue and improving Chrome extension reconnection behavior.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Investigated batch_get_responses Timeout Issue
- Found that the method implementation looks correct
- Issue was actually that Chrome extension wasn't connected to hub
- Root cause: Extension disconnection when Claude Code restarts

### 2. Fixed Chrome Extension Reconnection Issue
- **Problem**: When Claude Code restarts, extension loses connection and doesn't reconnect automatically
- **Root Cause**: 
  - MCP server owns hub and takes it down on exit
  - Extension reconnection was too slow (30-second intervals)
  - Long exponential backoff delays (up to 30 seconds)

### 3. Implemented Fast Reconnection
- **Reduced Delays**:
  - Base delay: 1s → 500ms
  - Max delay: 30s → 5s
  - Persistent retry: 30s → 5s
  - Connection timeout: 5s → 2s
- **Smart Detection**:
  - Immediate reconnection (100ms) on clean shutdown
  - Hub shutdown message triggers immediate reconnection
- **Persistent Retry**:
  - Continues trying every 5 seconds indefinitely
  - Resets backoff after 5 minutes of no activity

## Key Code Changes

### Extension Background.js
```javascript
// Faster reconnection timing
this.maxReconnectDelay = 5000; // Reduced from 30s
this.baseReconnectDelay = 500; // Reduced from 1s

// Detect clean shutdown for immediate reconnection
if (event.code === 1000 || event.code === 1001) {
  setTimeout(() => this.connectToHub(), 100);
}

// Persistent retry every 5 seconds
setInterval(() => {
  if (!this.isConnected()) {
    this.connectToHub();
  }
}, 5000);
```

### MCP Server
- Reduced connection timeout from 5s to 2s for faster hub detection

## Documentation Created
1. `/docs/development/reconnection-issue-analysis.md` - Detailed problem analysis
2. `/docs/development/reconnection-fix-summary.md` - Fix implementation details
3. `/tests/test-reconnection-behavior.js` - Interactive test script
4. `/shared/hub-port-check.js` - Port availability utilities (for future use)

## Testing
- Created interactive test script to verify reconnection behavior
- Expected reconnection time: < 5 seconds (improved from 30+ seconds)

## User Experience Improvements
- Extension reconnects automatically within 5 seconds when Claude Code restarts
- No manual reload required
- Clear status indicators in popup
- Better error messages

## Next Steps
1. Monitor reconnection behavior in real usage
2. Consider implementing hub takeover mechanism for orphaned hubs
3. Add reconnection status to popup UI
4. Test with multiple Claude Code instances

## Notes
- Extension is now much more responsive to hub availability
- Reconnection happens quickly enough that users won't notice brief disconnections
- The fix maintains backward compatibility while improving UX significantly
