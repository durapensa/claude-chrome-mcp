# Architecture Refactor Log

This document tracks the ongoing architecture refactoring effort across multiple sessions.

## Refactor Goals
1. Remove all polling patterns in favor of event-driven async
2. Implement centralized logging system
3. Clean up TODO items and incomplete features
4. Unify overlapping modules
5. Create centralized configuration
6. Implement proper async patterns (AbortController, Promise.race)
7. Update documentation to reflect current implementation

## Session 1: January 6, 2025

### Completed (Committed)
- [x] Removed backup files: `server-original.js`, `server-pre-tools-refactor.js` (commit: c3e2774)
- [x] Refactored OperationManager to use EventEmitter instead of polling (commit: a0e0007)
  - Replaced 100ms setTimeout polling with event-driven architecture
  - Added events: `operation:completed`, `operation:failed`, `operation:updated`
  - Proper cleanup of listeners and timeouts

### Requires Testing After Restart
1. **OperationManager EventEmitter functionality**
   - Test that operations complete without polling
   - Verify event emission and listener cleanup
   - Check timeout handling
   - Monitor performance improvements

### Next Tasks (Priority Order)
1. Implement centralized logging system
2. Remove/complete TODO items in production code
3. Unify tab-management.js and tab-operations.js
4. Create centralized configuration system

### Testing Commands After Restart
```bash
# 1. Verify system health
mcp__claude-chrome-mcp__get_connection_health

# 2. Test async operation with new EventEmitter
mcp__claude-chrome-mcp__spawn_claude_dot_ai_tab
mcp__claude-chrome-mcp__send_message_async --tabId <id> --message "Test EventEmitter: 5+5"
mcp__claude-chrome-mcp__wait_for_operation --operationId <operation_id>

# 3. Monitor for any polling-related console output
```

### Session Restart Checklist
- [ ] User exits Claude Code
- [ ] User restarts Claude Code
- [ ] Run health check
- [ ] Test EventEmitter changes
- [ ] Continue with next priority task

## Refactor Principles
1. **Incremental Changes**: Make 2-3 significant changes per session
2. **Test Before Proceeding**: Verify each change works before moving on
3. **Document Everything**: Keep this log updated with each change
4. **Commit Frequently**: Each logical change gets its own commit
5. **Maintain Backwards Compatibility**: Don't break existing functionality

## Known Constraints
- Cannot restart MCP server from within Claude Code
- Must coordinate restart timing with user
- Extension changes can be reloaded without restart
- Some changes may require both extension reload AND server restart
