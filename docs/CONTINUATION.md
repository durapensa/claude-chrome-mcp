# Session Continuation Guide

## Standard Continuation Workflow

When you type 'continue' in a fresh Claude Code instance:

### Step 1: System Health Check
```bash
mcp__claude-chrome-mcp__get_connection_health
```

### Step 2: Verify System Readiness
Check connection health output for:
- Hub connected status (or relay in WebSocket mode)
- Active client connections
- Any connection issues

### Step 3: Standard Testing Workflow
Once system is healthy:
1. **Spawn Tab**: `spawn_claude_dot_ai_tab --injectContentScript true`
2. **Async Message**: `send_message_async --message "test" --tabId <id>`
3. **Get Response**: `get_claude_dot_ai_response --tabId <id>`
4. **Claude-to-Claude**: `forward_response_to_claude_dot_ai_tab --sourceTabId <src> --targetTabId <tgt>`

### Step 4: If Issues Arise
Follow systematic debugging approach from [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#debugging-methodology):
- Use evidence-based network debugging
- Apply proper tool selection
- Avoid common anti-patterns

## Current System Status
- **Version**: 2.5.0 (WebSocket-only architecture)
- **Architecture**: WebSocket relay with offscreen documents
- **Key Features**: 
  - Async operations, Claude-to-Claude forwarding
  - WebSocket relay with health monitoring (port 54322)
  - Persistent connections via offscreen documents (12+ hours)
  - Pure message routing relay for simplified architecture
- **Status**: Production-ready WebSocket architecture
- **Important**: Extension needs manual reload, Claude Code needs restart after MCP server changes

## Latest Session Summary (2025-01-06 - Part 9: Production Features & Housekeeping)

### What Was Accomplished

1. **WebSocket Relay Successfully Tested**:
   - Confirmed bidirectional communication working
   - All MCP tools functioning through relay
   - Fixed response routing issues

2. **Added Production Features to Relay**:
   - Health monitoring endpoint on port 54322 (`/health`)
   - Real-time metrics tracking:
     - Messages routed, clients connected/disconnected
     - Uptime, errors, client details
   - Proper shutdown handling for health server

3. **Key Fixes Applied**:
   - Fixed offscreen document creation (valid reason: DOM_SCRAPING)
   - Fixed relay unicast message wrapping
   - Fixed extension command execution for relay mode
   - Added localhost WebSocket permissions to manifest

4. **Decision Made**: No need for HTTP backward compatibility
   - Will proceed with WebSocket-only architecture
   - Simplifies codebase significantly
   - Removes port conflicts and complexity

## Latest Session Summary (2025-01-06 - Part 10: WebSocket-Only Migration)

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Completed WebSocket-Only Migration**:
   - Removed all HTTP polling code from extension (711 lines removed)
   - Converted MCP server to relay-only mode
   - Removed websocket-hub.js and multi-hub-manager.js
   - Updated offscreen document to use relay port 54322
   - Simplified connection logic throughout system

2. **Tested End-to-End Flow**:
   - ✅ Connection health check
   - ✅ Async message sending and response retrieval
   - ✅ Claude-to-Claude response forwarding
   - ✅ Relay health monitoring (15 messages routed, 0 errors)

3. **Housekeeping Completed**:
   - Removed 1,554 lines of obsolete code
   - Deleted old hub system files
   - Removed duplicate test files (using v2 versions)
   - Cleaned up empty directories

### Session Handoff Point

**Current State**:
- WebSocket relay architecture fully operational
- System tested and working correctly
- Codebase cleaned and streamlined
- Ready for production use

### Running the System

1. **Start WebSocket relay FIRST**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1:
   ./test-websocket-relay.sh
   ```

2. **Then start Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 2:
   claude-code
   ```

3. **Verify relay is working**:
   ```bash
   # Check health endpoint:
   curl http://localhost:54322/health
   
   # Test in Claude Code:
   mcp__claude-chrome-mcp__get_connection_health
   ```

### Next Session: Production Readiness

1. **Create Production Deployment Guide**:
   - Document relay setup for production
   - Create systemd service files
   - Add monitoring and logging recommendations
   - Security considerations

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Analyze message routing performance
   - Optimize relay for high throughput
   - Add connection pooling if needed

3. **Error Handling Enhancement**:
   - Add automatic reconnection strategies
   - Improve error messages and diagnostics
   - Add circuit breaker patterns

4. **Documentation Polish**:
   - Update all diagrams for WebSocket-only
   - Create troubleshooting guide for relay
   - Add performance tuning guide
