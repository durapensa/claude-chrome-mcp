# Session Continuation Guide

## Standard Continuation Workflow

When you type 'continue' in a fresh Claude Code instance:

### Step 1: System Health Check
```bash
mcp__claude-chrome-mcp__get_connection_health
```

### Step 2: Verify System Readiness
Check connection health output for:
- Relay connected status (WebSocket mode)
- Active client connections
- Any connection issues

### Step 3: Standard Testing Workflow (OPTIONAL - only if user requests)
**Rule: Skip testing workflow by default unless user specifically asks for it**

If testing is requested:
1. **Spawn Tab**: `spawn_claude_dot_ai_tab --injectContentScript true`
2. **Async Message**: `send_message_async --message "test" --tabId <id>`
3. **Get Response**: `get_claude_dot_ai_response --tabId <id>`
4. **Claude-to-Claude**: `forward_response_to_claude_dot_ai_tab --sourceTabId <src> --targetTabId <tgt>`

### Step 4: Resume Active Work
- Read current todo list with TodoRead
- Continue with pending tasks from previous session
- If issues arise, follow [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#debugging-methodology)

## Key Documentation

- **IMPORTANT**: User needs to restart Claude Code to test embedded relay

### Running the System

1. **Just start Claude Code normally**:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```
   
   The embedded relay will automatically start:
   - First MCP server becomes relay host
   - Additional servers connect as clients
   - No separate relay process needed!

2. **Verify relay is working**:
   ```bash
   # Check health endpoint:
   curl http://localhost:54322/health
   
   # Test in Claude Code:
   mcp__claude-chrome-mcp__get_connection_health
   ```

## Previous Session Summary (2025-06-04 - System Assessment & Improvement Planning)

### System Health Verification âœ…

1. **Full System Operational**:
   - WebSocket relay connected and functioning as host
   - 2 active clients, 0 errors, 517+ seconds uptime
   - Standard testing workflow completed successfully:
     - Tab spawning with content script injection
     - Async messaging and response capture
     - Claude-to-Claude response forwarding

2. **Architecture Status**:
   - **MCP Server**: Embedded relay with automatic election operational
   - **Extension**: Offscreen document maintaining persistent WebSocket connections
   - **Message Flow**: Extension â†’ Offscreen â†’ WebSocket Relay â†’ MCP Server working correctly
   - **Performance**: 2 messages routed, 3 clients connected, 1 client disconnected

### Codebase Analysis & Improvement Opportunities

**Comprehensive search revealed priority improvement areas:**

1. **Incomplete Features (High Impact)**:
   - Artifact/code block extraction TODOs in `extension/modules/conversation-operations.js:183-184, 212, 230-231`
   - Clear user value with well-defined scope

2. **Code Quality Issues**:
   - 92+ console statements scattered across codebase (should use Winston logger)
   - Highest concentrations: background.js (28), relay-client.js (26), content-script-manager.js (21)

3. **Architecture Technical Debt**:
   - ~~Dual operation ID systems between Extension and MCP server~~ âœ… (MCP server is sole authority)
   - Module duplication: `tab-management.js` vs `tab-operations.js`
   - Architecture cleanup tracked in current todos

4. **Timer/Polling Optimization**:
   - Hardcoded timeouts and polling intervals could be more intelligent
   - Multiple 2-second waits and fixed heartbeat intervals

5. **Error Handling Enhancement**:
   - Many try-catch blocks could benefit from structured error handling
   - Could better leverage existing ErrorTracker utility

### Recommended Priorities (2025-06-04)

**Top 5 Improvement Opportunities:**

1. **Complete Artifact/Code Block Extraction** (High Impact)
   - Clear feature completion with obvious user value
   - Well-defined scope in conversation export functionality

2. **Centralized Logging System** (Code Quality)
   - Consolidate 92+ console statements into Winston logger
   - Improve debugging and maintainability

3. **Architecture Cleanup** (Technical Debt)
   - Fix dual operation ID systems
   - Consolidate duplicated modules
   - Resolve identified architecture inconsistencies

4. **Documentation Updates** (Quick Win)
   - Update roadmap to reflect completed WebSocket architecture
   - Ensure documentation matches current implementation

5. **Enhanced Error Handling** (Reliability)
   - Structured error handling with proper cleanup
   - Better utilization of existing ErrorTracker utility
