# Session Continuation Guide

## Standard Continuation Workflow

When you type 'continue' in a fresh Claude Code instance:

### Step 1: System Health Check
```bash
mcp__claude-chrome-mcp__get_connection_health
```

### Step 2: Verify System Readiness
Check connection health output for:
- Relay connected status (WebSocket mode)
- Active client connections
- Any connection issues

### Step 3: Standard Testing Workflow
Once system is healthy:
1. **Spawn Tab**: `spawn_claude_dot_ai_tab --injectContentScript true`
2. **Async Message**: `send_message_async --message "test" --tabId <id>`
3. **Get Response**: `get_claude_dot_ai_response --tabId <id>`
4. **Claude-to-Claude**: `forward_response_to_claude_dot_ai_tab --sourceTabId <src> --targetTabId <tgt>`

### Step 4: If Issues Arise
Follow systematic debugging approach from [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#debugging-methodology):
- Use evidence-based network debugging
- Apply proper tool selection
- Avoid common anti-patterns

## Key Documentation
- **[Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)**: System design and components
- **[Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**: Issues, debugging methodology, and solutions  
- **[TypeScript](TYPESCRIPT.md)**: Type definitions and development guidelines
- **[Restart Capability](RESTART-CAPABILITY.md)**: MCP lifecycle and restart mechanisms

## Development Resources
- **[Event-Driven Architecture](event-driven-architecture-diagram.md)**: Visual system overview
- **[GitHub Issue Script](create-claude-code-issue.sh)**: Claude Code integration utilities

## Current System Status
- **Version**: 2.5.0 (WebSocket-only architecture)
- **Architecture**: WebSocket relay with offscreen documents
- **Key Features**: 
  - Async operations, Claude-to-Claude forwarding
  - WebSocket relay with health monitoring (port 54322)
  - Persistent connections via offscreen documents (12+ hours)
  - Pure message routing relay for simplified architecture
  - MCP protocol-compliant client identification via clientInfo
- **Status**: Production-ready WebSocket architecture
- **Important**: Extension needs manual reload, Claude Code needs restart after MCP server changes

## Latest Updates (2025-01-06)
- Completed major refactor: All "hub" terminology replaced with "relay"
- Removed MCPClientDetector and hardcoded client identification
- System now uses MCP protocol's built-in clientInfo for client names
- Cleaned up all hardcoded client type mappings and CSS colors
- Extension displays client names exactly as provided by MCP protocol

## Latest Session Summary (2025-01-06 - Part 9: Production Features & Housekeeping)

### What Was Accomplished

1. **WebSocket Relay Successfully Tested**:
   - Confirmed bidirectional communication working
   - All MCP tools functioning through relay
   - Fixed response routing issues

2. **Added Production Features to Relay**:
   - Health monitoring endpoint on port 54322 (`/health`)
   - Real-time metrics tracking:
     - Messages routed, clients connected/disconnected
     - Uptime, errors, client details
   - Proper shutdown handling for health server

3. **Key Fixes Applied**:
   - Fixed offscreen document creation (valid reason: DOM_SCRAPING)
   - Fixed relay unicast message wrapping
   - Fixed extension command execution for relay mode
   - Added localhost WebSocket permissions to manifest

4. **Decision Made**: No need for HTTP backward compatibility
   - Will proceed with WebSocket-only architecture
   - Simplifies codebase significantly
   - Removes port conflicts and complexity

## Latest Session Summary (2025-01-06 - Part 10: WebSocket-Only Migration)

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Completed WebSocket-Only Migration**:
   - Removed all HTTP polling code from extension (711 lines removed)
   - Converted MCP server to relay-only mode
   - Removed websocket-hub.js and multi-hub-manager.js
   - Updated offscreen document to use relay port 54322
   - Simplified connection logic throughout system

2. **Tested End-to-End Flow**:
   - ✅ Connection health check
   - ✅ Async message sending and response retrieval
   - ✅ Claude-to-Claude response forwarding
   - ✅ Relay health monitoring (15 messages routed, 0 errors)

3. **Housekeeping Completed**:
   - Removed 1,554 lines of obsolete code
   - Deleted old hub system files
   - Removed duplicate test files (using v2 versions)
   - Cleaned up empty directories
   - Removed obsolete native messaging files (native-bridge.js, claude_chrome_mcp_bridge.json)

4. **Bug Fixes Applied**:
   - Fixed offscreen document port mismatch (54322 → 54321)
   - Fixed content script injection timing to wait for URL to be set
   - Fixed Claude-to-Claude forwarding by ensuring proper content script injection

## Latest Session Summary (2025-01-06 - Part 11: Embedded Relay Architecture)

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Implemented Embedded Relay with Election**:
   - Created EmbeddedRelayManager class for automatic relay election
   - First MCP server to start becomes relay host
   - Additional servers connect as clients
   - Automatic failover when relay host exits

2. **Fixed Architecture to Follow MCP Model**:
   - Relay no longer requires separate process
   - Works with MCP server spawning by hosts (Claude Code, etc.)
   - Simplified startup - just run Claude Code normally

3. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with embedded relay information
   - Updated test script to explain new architecture
   - Removed requirement for separate relay process

### Session Handoff Point

**Current State**:
- WebSocket relay architecture fully operational with embedded relay
- All MCP tools tested and working correctly
- Codebase cleaned and streamlined (removed 1,906 lines of obsolete code)
- Relay now embedded in MCP server with automatic election
- **IMPORTANT**: User needs to restart Claude Code to test embedded relay

### Running the System

1. **Just start Claude Code normally**:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```
   
   The embedded relay will automatically start:
   - First MCP server becomes relay host
   - Additional servers connect as clients
   - No separate relay process needed!

2. **Verify relay is working**:
   ```bash
   # Check health endpoint:
   curl http://localhost:54322/health
   
   # Test in Claude Code:
   mcp__claude-chrome-mcp__get_connection_health
   ```

## Latest Session Summary (2025-01-06 - Architecture Review & Cleanup)

### Architecture Alignment Review

1. **WebSocket Architecture Fully Implemented** ✅:
   - Offscreen documents are operational with persistent WebSocket connections
   - WebSocket relay is embedded in MCP server with automatic election
   - Extension uses WebSocket exclusively (no HTTP polling in implementation)
   - Architecture matches documented design in ARCHITECTURE.md

2. **Implementation Status**:
   - **MCP Server**: Modular architecture with embedded relay
   - **Extension**: Offscreen document maintains WebSocket connection
   - **Message Flow**: Extension → Offscreen → WebSocket Relay → MCP Server
   - **Coordination**: Extension acts as the brain for all coordination logic

3. **Minor Discrepancies Found**:
   - Stale comment in extension/background.js line 19 mentions "HTTP polling mode"
   - Hub directory still exists but wraps relay functionality (transitional state)

### Recommended Cleanup Steps

1. **Update Stale Comment**:
   - Fix extension/background.js line 19 to remove HTTP polling reference

2. **Consider Hub Removal**:
   - The hub/ directory has been removed and functionality moved to relay/
   - mcp-relay-client.js provides relay connection management

3. **Documentation Accuracy**:
   - ARCHITECTURE.md accurately reflects the implemented WebSocket-only design
   - CLAUDE.md correctly describes the embedded relay with automatic election
   - This CONTINUATION.md has been updated to reflect current state

### Current Production Status
- WebSocket-only architecture is fully operational
- Embedded relay with automatic election is working
- System is production-ready with health monitoring
- All MCP tools function correctly through the relay
