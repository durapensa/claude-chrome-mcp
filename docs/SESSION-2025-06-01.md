# Session Progress: June 1, 2025

## Session Overview
**Objective**: Debug MCP server premature exit and test forward_response tool
**Status**: Ready for extension reload + Claude Code restart

## Major Accomplishments

### âœ… Tested forward_response_to_claude_dot_ai_tab Tool
- Successfully spawned two Claude tabs (948571226, 948571227)
- Tested basic forwarding functionality
- Confirmed tool works correctly for Claude-to-Claude automation

### âœ… Identified Critical Bug: MCP Server Premature Exit
**Problem**: 
- MCP server exiting immediately when Claude Code still running
- Extension showing ghost "Claude Code" connection with 0 clients
- Contradictory state: extension claims connection but no server process

### âœ… Root Cause Analysis
**Transport Disconnect Issue**: 
- MCP server `emergencyShutdown()` on any stdio transport interruption
- No recovery mechanism - immediate `process.exit(1)`
- Extension retains stale client state when hub exits unexpectedly

### âœ… Implemented 4 Comprehensive Fixes

#### Fix 1: Resilient MCP Server Transport Handling
- **File**: `mcp-server/src/server.js`
- Added transport retry logic (max 3 retries, exponential backoff)
- Enhanced `ChromeMCPServer` with `handleTransportLoss()` and `restartTransport()`
- Prevent reconnection during shutdown with `isShuttingDown` flag

#### Fix 2: Extension Ghost Client State Cleanup  
- **File**: `extension/background.js`
- Added client timeout tracking (60s per client)
- Implemented `clearAllClients()` for immediate state cleanup
- Enhanced hub disconnect handlers to clear stale state immediately

#### Fix 3: Enhanced Hub Shutdown Logic
- **File**: `mcp-server/src/server.js` 
- Improved shutdown sequencing with proper notification delivery
- Added time delays for message processing before connection closure
- Graceful connection closure before termination

#### Fix 4: Health Monitoring & Recovery
- **File**: `mcp-server/src/server.js`
- Added health monitoring to `ProcessLifecycleManager`
- Implemented periodic health checks (30s intervals, 2min timeout)
- Enhanced activity tracking with `updateHeartbeat()`

## Git Status
- **Committed**: All fixes to git (commit `468a35e`)
- **Syntax**: Validated for both modified files
- **Pushed**: Changes available in remote repository

## Restart Sequence

### Phase 1: Extension Reload
1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Claude Chrome MCP" extension
3. Click reload button (ðŸ”„)
4. Verify popup shows "Hub: Not connected" (expected)

### Phase 2: Claude Code Manual Restart
1. Exit Claude Code completely (âŒ˜+Q)
2. Wait 5 seconds for process cleanup
3. Restart Claude Code
4. Reconnect to claude-chrome-mcp project

### Phase 3: Verification Tests
1. **Check Extension Status**: Should show "Connected to port 54321" with "Claude Code" client
2. **Test Tool**: Run `get_connection_health` 
3. **Expected**: No premature MCP server exits, accurate client state

## Next Steps After Restart
1. Verify fixes resolved ghost client issues
2. Test MCP server resilience (should not exit when Claude Code running)
3. Continue claude-chrome-mcp development as needed
4. **Optional**: Proceed with BFG Repo-Cleaner for `.operations-state.json` history cleanup

## Outstanding Items
- BFG Repo-Cleaner discussion for removing runtime state files from git history
- Continued testing of async workflow improvements

**Session End**: Ready for extension reload and Claude Code restart to test fixes.
