# Chrome Extension Reconnection Fix Summary

## Changes Made (2025-05-30)

### Problem
When Claude Code restarts, the Chrome extension loses connection to the WebSocket hub and doesn't automatically reconnect quickly. Users had to manually reload the extension.

### Root Cause
- MCP server owns the WebSocket hub and takes it down when shutting down
- Chrome extension's reconnection logic wasn't aggressive enough
- Long delays (up to 30 seconds) before reconnection attempts

### Fix Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Reconnection Properties (background.js)
```javascript
// Added to CCMExtensionHub constructor
this.lastConnectionAttempt = 0;
this.resetAttemptsAfter = 300000; // Reset after 5 minutes
this.persistentReconnectInterval = null;
this.maxReconnectAttempts = -1; // Infinite attempts
this.maxReconnectDelay = 5000; // Reduced from 30s to 5s
this.baseReconnectDelay = 500; // Reduced from 1s to 500ms
```

#### 2. Improved scheduleReconnect Method
- Resets reconnection attempts after 5 minutes of no activity
- Sets up persistent reconnection attempt every 5 seconds (reduced from 30s)
- Continues trying indefinitely until connected

#### 3. Immediate Reconnection on Clean Shutdown
- Detects clean hub shutdown (code 1000/1001) and reconnects after 100ms
- Handles hub shutdown messages with immediate reconnection
- Reduced connection timeout from 5s to 2s

#### 4. Connection Success Cleanup
- Clears persistent reconnection interval when connected
- Properly resets reconnection state

#### 5. Updated Keep-Alive Handler
- No longer attempts direct reconnection (prevents conflicts)
- Stores additional state for debugging

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
cd tests
chmod +x test-reconnection-behavior.js
node test-reconnection-behavior.js
```

Expected behavior:
1. Extension connects to hub when Claude Code starts
2. Extension shows disconnected when Claude Code stops
3. Extension automatically reconnects within 5 seconds when Claude Code restarts
4. No manual reload required

## Timing Improvements
- Initial reconnection: 500ms → 1s → 2s → 4s → 5s (max)
- Persistent reconnection: Every 5 seconds
- Clean shutdown detection: 100ms reconnection
- Connection timeout: 2 seconds (reduced from 5s)

## Files Modified
- `/extension/background.js` - Enhanced reconnection logic

## Next Steps
1. Test with actual usage patterns
2. Monitor for any edge cases
3. Consider adding connection status to popup UI
4. Add metrics for reconnection success rate
